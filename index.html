                    All classes of computer science are engaging, exciting, creative, and adventurous.<br>
                    In the classes you could use different software for artisitic minded invididuals, technical software for tech savvy individuals.<br>
                    What you won't find is no student that is not engaged in the learning hands-on process?<br>
                    Next time you are thinking what class you should pick, think some type of computer science class.<br>
